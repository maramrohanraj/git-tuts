*/
//* from working directory to staging area we will send one by one files 
/*

staging area-> local repo  ---> git commit
local repo -> remote repo ==> git push

*/



//*staging area
/* 
 it is in between the local repository and remote repository
 if we use staging area then we can commit what we need remaining will not be committed
